# Neural Network

Made to identify handwritten numbers of 0 to 9. Based on the book "Make Your Own Neural Network". Is necessary add the "mnist_dataset", because your size overtakes the maximum support by the GitHub (100MB). Datasets to be Downloadeds: http://www.pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv http://www.pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetw
ork/master/mnist_dataset/mnist_test_10.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetw
ork/master/mnist_dataset/mnist_train_100.csv 

You need to create a folder named mnist_dataset on the NeuralNetwork folder and put the datasets on there to the program work.
